	<h1><u> LUDHIANA </u></h1>
	<p>
	Ludhiana was founded in 1480 by members of the ruling Lodhi dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. The ruling sultan, Sikandar Lodhi, dispatched two ruling chiefs of his dynasty, Yusaf Khan and Nihand Khan, to assert Lodhi control over the region. The two men camped at the site of present Ludhiana, which was then a village called Mir Hota. Yusaf Khan crossed the Sutlej and established Sultanpur, while Nihand Khan founded Ludhiana on the site of Mir Hota. The name was originally "Lodhi-ana", meaning "Lodhi town", which has since shifted to the present form of Ludhiana. The Lodhi Fort, or "Purana Qila", is the only surviving structure in the city from this period
